### Why do you think the book is a must-read?

> This book tells the horrifying testimonies of six civilians in the days after the first atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima on August 6, 1945. 

> The narrative is written like that of a novel which makes us feel more closed to the people/characters. The atrocities and hardships these people and many other faced due to this bomb are depicted so vividly that sometimes you have to stop reading and tell yourself that humans did that to other humans.  

> The book has many heart-wrenching accounts that you would at least cry one time if not more. These stories will teach you to have faith and not lose your human soul even in the worst circumstances. 

> Overall it's an emotionally draining book, hard to get through, but very much worth the strain. Well written, well reached and very well thought out, it touches on all the important aspects of the bombing. I highly recommend it.

### Does this book contain any profane, violent or vulgar content?
