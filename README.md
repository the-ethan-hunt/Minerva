## Motivation

The Roman goddess of wisdom and literature strongly recommends you to read these books to make you an 'enlightened' person and 
give you her blessing.
But since she herself cannot descend upon the Earth, she has instructed a group of readers to make this list and thus enlighten people.

### Details

> [Details like Title, Author, Genre and the Goodreads page of the book]

> **Author:** Bram Stoker

> **Genre:** Classics, Horror, Fantasy, Fiction, Paranormal, Vampires

> **Goodreads:**  3.98 Stars -  774,367 Ratings - 19,682 Reviews

### Why do you think the book is a must-read?

> It's the most well-known vampire novel.
> It's classic.
> The story itself is heartbreaking, full of the emotion of the characters as they deal with life, death and love, this is beautifully realised. 
> The main characters are all very well portrayed, each with a separate personality, quirks and role to play in the story. 
> The plot is too complicated for reproduction, but it says no little  for the authors powers that in spite of its absurdities the reader can follow the story with interest to the end. It is, however, an artistic mistake to fill the whole volume with horrors. A touch of the mysterious, the terrible, or the supernatural is infinitely more effective and credible. (The Manchester Guardian, June 15, 1897)
